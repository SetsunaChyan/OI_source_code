We all know the Pythagorean Theorem: $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$,among them, $3,4,5$ is a continuous natural number; At the same time, there is a relationship between the continuous natural number $10,11,12,13,14: 10^2+11^2+12^2=13^2+14^2$. What inspiration do you get from it?

Question: Give the natural number $n (1 < n < 1000)$, please judge whether there is $2n + 1$ continuous natural number, satisfying that the sum of squares of left $n + 1$ number equals the sum of squares of right $n$ number. If it exists, output the $2n + 1$ numbers.

\InputFile
Input a positive natural number $n (1 < n < 1000)$.
\OutputFile
If it exists, output the $2n+1$ numbers, with a space between each two numbers（{\bfseries Notes：No extra space is allowed at the end of the line**}）; otherwise output "No".
